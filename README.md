## Description
For my dissertation project in my 3rd year of university, I decided to do research and create an Audio Hate Speech Detector (that uses artificial intelligence). This contains a model that can detect hate speech in audio. It also contains additional code that I used to train my models. 

## Installation
Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaziz1234/Audio-Hate-Speech-Detector.git
```

Once the repository is installed, simnply open up the main.py file (located in /Hate_Speech_Detector_Model/) in any IDE, and run it. Then follow the instructions as shown on the console.
